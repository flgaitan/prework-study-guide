# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was created to introduce the concepts of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript into the mindset and the role of a successful web developer.
THe motivation for the project is to successfully complete all the steps required to launch our webpage 
but also to undertsand more in detail all the steps and how each program and each branch work all 
together to bring our project to life. At the same time it is teaching us fundamentals actions that we
will be applying to our projects in the future.
This project aids to solve the problem of collaborating alone and having a private website by launching 
it through a public platform which is Gitpages but making it accessible for other like minded 
collaborators to access it and view, contribute, and assess our project.
This project has taught me that there are many moving parts in putting together a web page. As a 
developer it is important to be knowledgeable and focused on why and how we want our project to
look like, to perform and to serve the public. I have also learned that there are different ways to
go about a task, and there are ways to disrupt, decode and execute a code depending on the program
we are using. It is exciting and yet frightening to know just how much information there is to learn
out there and just how much can be created with the different languages that exist.

## Installation

## Usage

We used HTML to build the structure of the webpage, CSS as a way to style it and GIT and JavaScript
components to make it move and interact the way we intended it to. We learned that through also using
tools accessible to us like ChromeDev we can Inspect our website and in the console see what codes we
have used and what we've created which is so cool and useful to understand functionality of our project.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
